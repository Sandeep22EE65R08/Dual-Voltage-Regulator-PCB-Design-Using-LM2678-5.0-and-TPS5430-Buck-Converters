Dual-Voltage Regulator PCB Design Using LM2678-5.0 and TPS5430 Buck Converters


In this project, I designed a dual-voltage regulator PCB using Altium Designer, featuring LM2678-5.0 and TPS5430 buck converters. The circuit steps down a 12V input to a stable 5V output with selectable current capacities of 5A or 3A through an SPDT switch. The design includes essential components like inductors, Schottky diodes, and capacitors to minimize ripple and ensure efficient power delivery, making it suitable for high-performance applications. This project highlights my expertise in PCB design, power management, and embedded systems.
